# Basic Obstacle Avoidance Robot  

This is a simple Arduino-based **Obstacle Avoidance Robot** using an **ultrasonic sensor** for distance measurement and motor control with an **L298N motor driver**. The robot moves forward and stops or changes direction when it detects an obstacle.  

## Features  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** for obstacle detection  
- **L298N Motor Driver** for controlling two DC motors  
- **Simple navigation logic** using distance measurements  
- **Autonomous movement** with basic obstacle avoidance  

## Looking for a More Advanced Version?  
This project provides **basic** obstacle avoidance functionality. If you want a **more advanced version** with **IR sensors** for side detection and improved navigation logic, check out this project:
