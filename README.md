# üöó Arduino Self-Driving Car with HC-SR04

This is an **Arduino-based self-driving car** that uses an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect obstacles and navigate autonomously. The car moves forward until it detects an obstacle within a certain range, then it stops, reverses, and turns before continuing.

## üìå Features
- **Obstacle detection** using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **Automatic movement** (forward, reverse, left turn, right turn).
- **Collision avoidance** with real-time distance measurement.
